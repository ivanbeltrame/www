My website is made with only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It does **not require** JavaScript to be visited properly.

This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). You have to install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) to be able to use it.
Once everything is installed, you can run `jekyll serve` to built it.
